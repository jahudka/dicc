# DICC Documentation

DICC is a Dependency Injection Container Compiler for TypeScript. It analyses
one or more of your project's source files and produces a new TypeScript file,
which exports a DI container instance configured to create your project services
and autowire dependencies between them.


## Installation

DICC is split into two packages, because the compiler depends on TypeScript
and ts-morph, which are probably both something you want to be able to prune
from your production node modules. The runtime package is tiny and doesn't have
any other dependencies.

```shell
# Compile-time dependency:
npm i --save-dev dicc-cli

# Runtime dependency:
npm i --save dicc
```
